# magento-resources

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will compile style.scss into style.css.

I have created a ./partial folder. in here I suggest we create files with a sensible name. For example, we can use a file named "designer.scss" where we can put everything related to the index page of the designers.
This way we know what does what and it is easier then to move things to the repository.

The style.css file is going to be loaded on the magento installation, and is available at this url: https://raw.githack.com/navabiGmbH/magento-resources/master/style.css

Works with node 6 and up
